YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING:

This project is aimed at harvesting data from YouTube, storing it in both SQL and MongoDB databases, and visualizing the data using a Streamlit web application.

OVERVIEW:

YouTube is one of the largest repositories of video content on the internet.
This project aims to collect data from YouTube, including video metadata, statistics, and comments, and store it in a structured manner for further analysis.
The harvested data is stored in both SQL and NoSQL databases for comparison and flexibility in data retrieval.
Leveraging SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, this project provides a robust solution for harvesting vast amounts of 
YouTube data, storing it in structured databases, and presenting it through an intuitive web interface.
Finally, a Streamlit web application is built to provide an interactive interface for exploring and visualizing the data.

KEY COMPONENTS:


1. Data Harvesting::        

Utilizes the YouTube Data API to fetch video metadata, statistics, and comments.
Implements efficient data retrieval strategies to handle large volumes of data.

2. Storage:

Stores harvested data in both SQL and MongoDB databases for flexibility and comparison.
SQL database ensures structured storage for easy querying and analysis.
MongoDB offers NoSQL flexibility for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.

3. Visualization:

Employs Streamlit, a powerful Python library, to create an interactive web application.
Provides intuitive data visualization tools for exploring YouTube data.
Enables users to analyze trends, patterns, and insights derived from the harvested data.



TECHNOLOGIES USED:


* Python:

Programming language used for the project implementation.

* SQL:
  
Utilized for structured storage and querying of YouTube data.

* MongoDB:

NoSQL database employed for flexible and scalable data storage.

 
* Streamlit:

Framework used to develop the interactive web application.
